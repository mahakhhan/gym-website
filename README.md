# Gym Website

## Project Overview
This project was originally developed as part of a lab assignment where a Gym Management System was required using Flask, HTML, and CSS.  
For deployment purposes, the website is now hosted as a **static website** on GitHub Pages, so it runs using only HTML, CSS, and images.

## Live Website
You can view the website here:
https://mahakhhan.github.io/gym-website/

## Folder Structure
- `index.html` – Home Page  
- `about.html` – About Us Page  
- `membership.html` – Membership Plans Page  
- `style.css` – Website Styling  
- `images/` – All images and icons  

## Features
- Home page with welcome content and gym introduction
- About Us page with details about facilities
- Membership page displaying plans and prices
- Fully responsive layout
- Hosted on GitHub Pages

## Note
The original version of this project used Flask with:
- `templates/` folder
- `static/` folder
- `app.py`

However, for GitHub Pages deployment, it has been converted and structured as a static website.
